<H1>Bears forever home journey</H1>
 <IMG SRC="vermont.jpg">
<P>On one cold December afternoon in Vermont, Bear was chosen by a family of 6 to come home to Massachusetts.Bear had a brown lab dad and yellow lab mom and many brothers and sisters.
<p> To the owners suprise, Bear who seemed calm and cuddly at first sight, was actually the craziest pup in the liter!</p>
She traveled all the way down to Massachusetts, where she met the rest of her family. She was greeted with many toys and a large backyard where she could chase squirrels and dig holes to nowhere.</P>
Bear had found her forever home and forever family!</p>
Here is a picture of Bear after digging a hole and realizing that it was not the smartest idea...
